# Java-Poker-Game-Files
This repository contains the Java poker game that I wrote from scratch. There are a few errors in the algorithms that decide the winner and also in the game structure itself, but those should be easily fixable. I wrote this code completely for fun so it is a tad messy. I did not reference any other card game related code when designing  this as I wanted it to be a challenge.

This game currently works allowing an unlimited number of users to play against each other for chips in the command prompt. Each use user enters a unique password that is needed to view the cards in their hand and enter their betting decisions. 

My goal with this project is to workout all the logical erros and then use the GROUPME or DISCORD API to create a Cardgame BOT which will allow my friends and I to play poker in our chat lobbies using our phones or our PC's. The bot would send all the table information to the main group message but direct message the cards in a players hands to them.
